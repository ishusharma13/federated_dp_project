# federated_dp_project
This project simulates federated learning with differential privacy on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. Multiple clients train a CNN locally, applying gradient clipping and noise addition for privacy. Federated averaging aggregates updates to produce a robust global model, demonstrating a privacy-preserving ML framework.
